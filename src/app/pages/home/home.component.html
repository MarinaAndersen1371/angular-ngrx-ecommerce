      This is an Angular-NGRX based Application.</h4>
    <h5>
      In building of the project I am using "Oopcoders.com" tutorial materials, but I have created the backend
      differently - using Node express, MongoDB, seeder etc. instead of a fake json-server. The frontend is built by
      using Angular 13, NGRX tools, Bootstrap, Spinner and Alert effects etc.<br /> I have
      modified
      on my way Shopping Cart procedure (cart items should be saved to the user data) and Place
      Order procedure (an order creation triggers update of the shopping cart and reduction of the ordered items
      quantity in the products stock). Furthermore, I
      have added some
      features, for example
      User Registration, Ticket, User Profile, Mailbox and Notification Email, Product Review and Rating, Order Return,
      form
      validation, responsive
      navbar, password reset etc. <br />
      Some another of my ideas in this project:<br />
      - Premium Membership (free shipping and loyalty points voucher): once the fee is paid, the status should be
      updated automatically and displayed in the user profile, in place order procedure. Manager area allows to generate
      coupon (loyalty points voucher). Voucher discount will be displayed in order summary by coupon/voucher
      submission.<br />
      - Franchise Membership: once the fee is paid, user should get access to the test completion, which should be
      automatically validated and the result should be displayed, etc.

      You can check out the project functionality using sample users credentials:<br>
      admin@web.de / manager@web.de / klava@web.de / all passwords: 123456
      <br>
      Also you can register your own user.
